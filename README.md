Recreational project to transcribe the JOSS-I listings for JOHNNIAC.

The idea is to make the listings easily processable again.
Maybe this will lead to good things?

Text entered aims to be identical to the listings with spaces, no tabs.

Currently being transcribed:

 * [JOSS listing](http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/rand/joss/JOSS_Listing.pdf)

Still under consideration:

 * [JOSS listing](http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/rand/joss/JOSS_666_Listing_Jan65.pdf) from january 1965.
 * [JOSS program notes and tests](http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/rand/joss/JOSS_Program_Notes_and_Tests.pdf)
